# Toucher-app-for-Windows
A transparent floating text entry box to perform quick actions
The applicaiton is written in python that creates a floating window that always stays on top to quick access files and folders with a predefined nick name for each files or folders.
If a new nick name is entered that does not exists in the data base then a file browser is poped up to select a file or a folder for the new nick name.
Transparency action is also added. to higlight or de-highlight double click on the text box.
To move the text box click on the text entry and drag.

Planning to add more updates to perform mathamatical operations and open browser links etc.
